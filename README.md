### **Process and Methodology**

**1. Data Extraction:**
   - Extracted sales data for the year 2022 from multiple sources including Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra, along with customer demographics (age, gender, location) and order details (status, product categories).
   - Imported the data into Excel using the *Get & Transform* tool.

**2. Data Cleaning:**
   - **Handled missing values**: Used imputation for missing sales values and cleaned up null values for categorical fields.
   - **Removed duplicates**: Ensured there were no repeated records of orders or customers using the *Remove Duplicates* tool.
   - **Standardized formats**: Adjusted date, currency, and text fields to ensure consistency across the dataset.
   - **Corrected data errors**: Applied conditional formatting to identify outliers and ensure accurate data in fields like order statuses and channels.

**3. Data Analysis:**
   - **Comparison of sales and orders**: Created a combination chart with monthly sales (bar) and orders (line) to visualize trends.
   - **Identified peak sales month**: Used a Pivot Table and bar chart to highlight the month with the highest sales and orders.
   - **Gender-based purchases**: A pie chart revealed that women contributed ~65% of total sales in 2022.
   - **Order statuses**: Analyzed and visualized different order statuses (completed, pending, canceled) using a bar chart.
   - **Top 10 contributing states**: Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh emerged as the top 3 sales-contributing states.
   - **Relationship between age and gender**: A stacked bar chart showed that the 30-49 age group made the largest contribution (~50%) to total sales, with women dominating this category.
   - **Sales channel performance**: Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra were the top-performing channels, as shown in a pie chart.
   - **Highest-selling product category**: A bar chart revealed the top-selling categories for Vrinda Store in 2022.
